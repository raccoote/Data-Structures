# File Word Counter in C++
This C++ program analyzes the performance of five data structures — UnsortedArray, SortedArray, BinaryTree, AVLtree, and HashTable—in handling text data. It starts by cleaning a text file (lowercasing and removing punctuation) and then benchmarks each structure by measuring how long it takes to insert words and search for them. Results, including search times and word counts, are shown in the terminal and saved to an output file. 


Displayed are the outcomes of the code tested on a modest file comprising 32,000 lines. It's noteworthy that testing with larger files (over 2 GB) would reveal bigger differences in performance across the data structures.
